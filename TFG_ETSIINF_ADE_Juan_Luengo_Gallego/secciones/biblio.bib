abstract = {Foreign exchange volatility challenges auditors for not only demanding more audit efforts but also imposing heightened audit risk. We first show foreign exchange risks increase cash flow uncertainty and reduce financial reporting quality, supporting our premise that foreign exchange risks increase audit risk. Next, we find audit fees are higher for MNCs with greater exposure to foreign exchange volatility, but not when MNCs use financial hedging against foreign exchange risk. Furthermore, we show that the impact of foreign exchange risk on audit fees is attenuated by auditor MNC expertise, auditor busyness, and MNC’s operation diversity, whereas the impact is exacerbated for companies facing high pressure to avoid missing earnings targets and for auditors with high market concentration. Overall, our study provides novel evidence of the implications of MNCs’ exposure to foreign exchange risk on financial reporting and auditing, thereby enriching our understanding of MNCs.}

It then explains how regulation has become a key tool to advance European integration, giving these institutions a powerful motivation to pursue an ambitious regulatory agenda. It also argues how the creation of the single market was always the primary concern for the EU institutions. For a long time, the Brussels Effect was an ancillary and largely unintended by-product of a regulatory agenda that was driven by internal motivations. Only more recently, a conscious external agenda has emerged alongside this internal agenda.},
